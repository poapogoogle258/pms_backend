    In this exercise, you have to answer questions about Comparator_ and Comparable_.

    We are going to work on the Plant_, Tree_, Flower_ and Sorter_ classes. Read and understand the code in this classes before doing this is exercise!

    All the information on how the different method should work are given in comments in each class.

    .. warning::

        In the code, when we write "in that order", we mean that you must first sort in function of the first criterion, and in case of equality, sort in function of the second, and so on.
