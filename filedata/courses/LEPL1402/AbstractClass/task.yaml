    In this task, you have to implement the following code represented by this UML diagram :

    .. figure:: /course/LEPL1402/AbstractClass/AbstractClass.jpg
       :scale: 100 %
       :alt: alternate text
       :align: center
       :figclass: align-center

    Before jumping to the code, a few things to keep in mind :
      - Shape and all its methods are abstract (since instantiating a Shape class doesn't make sense )
      - Don't forget every needed modifier, keywords, etc (abstract, public, ...) as your classes are stored inside another package that the one for the testing
      - No need of instance variables in your code as we pass you the needed parameter to apply your computation
      - Use Math.PI in your Circle implementation
      - Advanced feedback are available only if your code has complied
