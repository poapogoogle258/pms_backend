    In this task, you have to implement the Observer design pattern in the context of a weather station:

    .. code-block:: java

        public class WeatherStation extends Observable {
            // YOUR CODE HERE
        }


        public class Client extends Observer {
            // YOUR CODE HERE
        }

    Note that Observable_ and Observer_ are two abstract classes containing abstract methods.
    You should therefore check and read them carefully in order to implement things correctly.
    For your ``Client`` class, you have to extend the ``Observer`` class and implement a constructor (do not forget instance variables).
    For the ``WeatherStation`` class, extend the ``Observable`` abstract class.
    You'll have to use Pair_ objects for this one.

    Note that your observers start to receive messages at the moment they subscribe but they should not see messages that were broadcast before they subscribed.
    They should only get sent weather alerts relative to their own zone.

    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains a few tests to help you.
