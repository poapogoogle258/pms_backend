    In this exercise you have to complete classes FTree_, Node_ and Leaf_.
    Ftree_ is an abstract class that represents a binary tree. It is extended by Node and Leaf.
    A Node_ is an FTree_ with two children (left and right) and a value.
    A Leaf_ is terminal, so it has a value but no children.

    Within the FTree_ class, you have to *recursively* implement:
        - ``depth()``: returns the depth of the tree (we assume that the tree is balanced)
        - ``map()``: returns a new FTree obtained by applying the function received as argument on all the values contained in the tree

    To complete the Node_ class, you must:
        - implement the constructor
        - extend FTree_

    To complete the Leaf_ class, you must :
        - implement the constructor
        - extend FTree_

    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains a few tests to help you.
