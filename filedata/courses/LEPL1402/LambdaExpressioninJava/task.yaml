    In this exercise you will learn to use basic lambda expressions. Since you are going to use them later, they are worth a small introduction exercise.

    Do note that, as we're working with lambdas, we've decided to block the ``return`` statement.

    You can click on the following links to find the java documentation about Function_, Predicate_ and Comparator_.
