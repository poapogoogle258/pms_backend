    In this task, we will ask you to implement the mehtod ``equals(Object o)`` for both classes Tree_ and Node_. Two instances of ``Tree`` are considered
    equal when they both have the exact same structure (same number of nodes, each node at the same place in **both** trees) and when every node has the same ``val``.
    Here are the skeleton of both classes:

    .. code-block:: java

        public class Node {

            public int val;
            public Node left;
            public Node right;

            public Node(int val){
                this.val = val;
            }

            public boolean isLeaf(){
                return this.left == null && this.right == null;
            }

            @Override
            public boolean equals(Object o){
                // YOUR CODE HERE
            }
        }

        public class Tree {

            public Node root;

            public Tree(Node root){
                this.root = root;
            }

            @Override
            public boolean equals(Object o){
                // YOUR CODE HERE
            }

        }
