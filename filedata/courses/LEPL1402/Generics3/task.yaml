    In this task, you have to implement this well-known full adder logic circuit:

    .. figure:: /course/LEPL1402/Generics3/full-adder-circuit.png
       :scale: 100 %
       :alt: alternate text
       :align: center
       :figclass: align-center

    Instead of computing the result directly by using a chain of logical operators (which can lead to error prone code),
    you're asked to implement the various logic gates the circuit requires first.
    The way you'll implement these is by defining, for each logic gate, a method that returns a BiFunction_ or Function_ that computes the logical operation.

    Once you've managed to define these logic gates, you're asked to implement the whole circuit within the ``evaluate_circuit(Boolean a, Boolean b, Boolean carry_in)``
    method. You are not allowed to use any of the built-in logic operators within this method (i.e., you cannot use ``&``, ``|``, ``!`` or ``^`` within this method).
    Do note this method returns a ``Map<String, Boolean>``, which stores the two outputs of the computation under keys ``SUM`` and ``carry_out``. 


    Your task is thus to implement the following class: Evaluator_.
    You can download the `IntelliJ Project`_ that contains a few tests to help you.
