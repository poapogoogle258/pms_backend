How to file a Github issue for an INGInious task
------------------------------------------------

If you spot a bug inside an [INGInious](https://www.inginious.org) task, please describe the problem with as many details as possible to reproduce it by [creating an issue on Github](https://github.com/UCL-INGI/LSINF1252/issues/new)

The first point to report in your bug report is to clearly identify the exercise that did not work as expected. Each exercise is identified by a unique name that you can find in its URL. See the screenshot below for an example.

The second point is to clearly explain the problem that you found. Try to be as precise as possible and explain how you think that the problem should be solved. If the problem is related to one of your submissions, please provide the unique identifier of your submission to enable us to reproduce the problem and fix it. Your submission identifier appears in the feedback as an hexadecimal number that starts with a #, see the example below.
