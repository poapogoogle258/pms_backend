context: 'A hacker wanted to challenge you and encrypted your hard drive. To unlock
  your drive, he gave you a function ``get_key(int a, char b, int c)`` which returns
  the decryption key if the correct parameters are given.


  He then hid the parameters *a*, *b* and *c* in memory, and gave you a pointer from
  which you can retrieve these parameters.'
