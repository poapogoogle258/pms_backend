        name: Using a variable in a Makefile
        answer: $(CC)

            In your Makefile, you have the following variable definition:

            .. code-block:: console

                CC = gcc

            What do you type to use it in other parts of your Makefile?

        name: Valgrind
        header: |-
            You want to check for leaks in your code ``program`` with valgrind. What option(s) do you use to report all possible memory leaks of ``program`` in full detail?

            Write the whole command you want to output, for instance     :

            ``valgrind --option-name program``
