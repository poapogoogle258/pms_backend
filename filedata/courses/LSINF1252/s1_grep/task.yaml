context: The `grep(1) command <https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/manpages/man1/grep.1.html>`_
    can be used to detect or extract lots of information from text files. When working
    with source code, `grep(1) <https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/manpages/man1/grep.1.html>`_
    can help you to find in which files some functions or constants have been defined.
    For this exercise, we will use the source code of the `CUnit <http://cunit.sourceforge.net>`_
    testing framework that you can download as a `tar archive  <https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LSINF1252/s1_grep/CUnit.tar>`_.

    CU_trim_left:

        name: CU_trim_left
        answer: Util.h
        header: In which file has the ``CU_trim_left`` been defined ? Answer with
            the name of the file.
    CU_UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER_pTest:
        header: '``CU_UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(pTest)`` appears in file ``Sources/Console/Console.c``
            Can you indicate the line number of this command ?'
        type: match
        name: CU_UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(pTest);
        answer: '652'
    assert:
        name: assert
        type: match
        answer: '349'
        header: |-
            The function ``assert`` is frequently used in the CUnit source code. Can you count the number of lines where ``assert`` appears in all the files of the working directory?
