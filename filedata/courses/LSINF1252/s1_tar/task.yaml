    Unix users often need to backup files and directories or send them over the Internet. `tar(1) <https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/manpages/man1/tar.1.html>`_ is a very useful tool which can be used to create compressed archives of directories and all the files that they contain. At the end of a project, you will have created the following files (you can download them from `here <https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LSINF1252/s1_tar/Enonce.zip>`_)

    .. code-block:: console

        /
            file
            folder1/
                file1.c
                file2.c
                file3.c
            folder2/
                file1.h
                fime2.h
                file3.h

    Using `tar(1) <https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/manpages/man1/tar.1.html>`_, create a ``.tar.gz`` compressed archive which contains all these files and directories and submit it below.
